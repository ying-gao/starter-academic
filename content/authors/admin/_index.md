Ying Gao is a Ph.D. candidate in political science at MIT, where she is a Graduate Research Fellow at MIT Governance Lab, and studies political economy and comparative politics. Her dissertation research examines citizen-state relations in urban contexts of development through the lens of urban informality, focusing on how informal housing communities shape governance through collective action, public goods, and subjective perceptions of what it means to participate in politics. She looks at these questions using an array of observational and quasi-experimental methods, and at global and local scales, leveraging cross-national public opinion data and administrative, spatial, and survey data from Indonesia. Some of Ying’s other research projects explore the influence of platform economy and innovative labor organizing in developed and developing economies, migration-induced ethnic diversity and public goods, and informal accountability, among other interests. In 2020-2021, she also works as Democracy Visiting Fellow at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, Harvard Kennedy School.
