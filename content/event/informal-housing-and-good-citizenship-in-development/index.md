title: Informal Housing and Good Citizenship in Development
abstract: What is the role of urban informal housing (slums) in shaping the
  politics of public goods provision in the developing world? I propose that
  informal housing leads to collective public goods provision by community
  residents, engendering community-bound social capital while lowering citizen
  expectation of official public goods in the long-run. I examine this argument
  using cross-national public opinion surveys, household panel surveys, and
  evidence from policy variations.
