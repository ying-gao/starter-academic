abstract: >-
  Using original representative mobile survey of Indonesian informal workers, I
  show

  that informal workers generally have lower support for strict public health policies,

  but social capital in the form of particularistic local associations can increase policy

  acceptance. Using survey experiment, I also show that voluntary compliance rises

  significantly when information is communicated via such associations, while direct

  digital messaging from the government is met with skepticism. The results apply across

  informal workers in traditional sectors as well as those in jobs affected by emerging

  digital platforms. This evidence points to the importance of incorporating social

  capital not only in pandemic control, but also in designing public policies encouraging

  sustainable labor market formalization.
