abstract: Using original representative mobile survey of Indonesian informal
  workers, I show that informal workers generally have lower support for strict
  public health policies, but social capital in the form of particularistic
  local associations can increase policy acceptance. Using survey experiment, I
  also show that voluntary compliance rises significantly when information is
  communicated via such associations, while direct digital messaging from the
  government is met with skepticism. The results apply across informal workers
  in traditional sectors as well as those in jobs affected by emerging digital
  platforms. This evidence points to the importance of incorporating social
  capital not only in pandemic control, but also in designing public policies
  encouraging sustainable labor market formalization.
