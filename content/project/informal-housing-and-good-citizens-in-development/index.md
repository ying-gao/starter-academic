What is the role of urban informal housing (slums) in shaping the politics of public goods provision in the developing world?  According to the UN, 881 million people, or 33% of global urban population, reside in slums, or urban informal settlements.  The perspective of housing informality can illuminate an underexplored area of how inequality determines not only material conditions of individuals and families, but also how ordinary citizens, as groups, socialize, engage with public policy, and become politically active, particularly in fast-urbanizing middle-income economies.

Hence, this dissertation examines the housing dimensions of citizen-state relations in contemporary developing cities. It focuses on how informal housing communities shape collective action, public goods provision, and subjective perceptions citizens hold about what it means to participate in politics. I propose that informal housing leads to collective public goods provision by community residents, engendering community-bound social capital while lowering citizen expectation of official public goods in the long run, with surprising consequences. The research looks at these hypotheses using an array of observational and quasi-experimental methods, and at global and local scales, leveraging cross-national public opinion data and administrative, spatial, and large survey data from Indonesia.
