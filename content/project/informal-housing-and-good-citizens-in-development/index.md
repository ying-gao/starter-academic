What is the role of urban informal housing (slums) in shaping the politics of public goods provision in the developing world?  I propose that informal housing leads to collective public goods provision by community residents, engendering community-bound social capital while lowering citizen expectation of official public goods in the long run.  I examine this argument using cross-national public opinion surveys, household panel surveys, and evidence from policy variations.  

According to the UN, 881 million people, or 33% of global urban population, reside in slum or informal settlements, but scholars have traditionally focused on labor market dynamics to explain the politics of urban informal economy.  Analysis of variation in housing informality can illuminate an underexplored area of conditions under which inequality can shape how low-resourced citizens engage with the state through public goods, particularly in middle-income countries.
